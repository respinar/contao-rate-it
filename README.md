# Contao Rate It

This package **hofff/contao-rate-it** is a fork of Contao extension **Rate It**, provided as

## Configuration

You man want to configure the bundle using the application configuration (`config/config.yml` or `app/config/config.yml`)
depending on your project. Right now you are only able to disable supported content types.

```
# Default configuration
hofff_contao_rate_it:
    types:
        page:                 true
        article:              true
        news:                 true
        module:               true
        ce:                   true
```

If you use Contao just as a Symfony bundle (not a managed edition), don't forget to add the routing information to your `routes.yaml`:
```
# routes.yaml
HofffContaoRateItBundle:
    resource: '@HofffContaoRateItBundle/config/routing.xml'
```
